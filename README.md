# REMWaste-TA

Normally, my approach for the redesign would be as follows:

- Establish the key features that are required from the redesign, what kind of elements does the client 
- Create a mockup of the new design and approve it with the client with the changes
- Prepare the stack and initialize the project

However, I could not contact the task manager to answer the necessary questions on the requirements for the task,
be it extension and tool restrictions or the scope of the redesign (the requirement to keep all the main functionality the same
made it more challenging to figure out on my own). 

With that in mind I had to improvise and make the changes noticeable, but not too extreme to affect the workflow of the original page, 
which proved to be challenging since the existing design was already on a decent level and the redesign is supposed to be on the same level of quality at the very least.

Another challenge was not to rely on extensions since I do not know how the rest of the page is build and what systems 
could they potentially remper with.

Additionally, the task did not provide me with images to use so I went with placeholders instead.


Now from here, it is the usual workflow, I used the free version of Figma to create a draft of the new design, 
Google tools helped me with palette choice. 
I have also had some of the codebase from previous project that I could partly apply and reuse here

After all the preparations were completed, I have organised the component structure and started assembling them one by one:
Main, Header, SkipCard and SkipGrid, footer.

Then there was the phase of testing and adjustments which didn't take too long.
